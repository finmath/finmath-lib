Languages and Build
--------------------------------------

The library is available for Java 11 and Java 8. We are starting to provide examples in Kotlin.

The Maven build file is provide. Import the project as Maven project.

The default Maven profile is Java 11 without Kotlin. To enable Java 8 version select the Maven profile 'java-8'. To enable Kotlin select the Maven profile 'kotlin'.


Releases
--------------------------------------

Binary releases can be found at http://finmath.net/finmath-lib .
The version numbering of finmath-lib follows a the *[semantic versioning](https://semver.org)* 
(at least we try to).


Distribution
--------------------------------------

finmath lib is distributed through the central maven repository. It's coordinates are:

For the Java 11 version:

    <groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
    <artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    
For the Java 8 version:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>3.6.3</version>
	<classifier>java8</classifier>

*Note: finmath-lib Version 4 and 5 is currently not available for Java 6. For Java 6 you may try version 3.6.3 with classifier java6.*


You may build the Java 11 version via Maven using

	mvn -P java-11

and the Java 8 version using

	mvn -P java-8
	
Source code
-------------------------------------

The finmath lib Java library comes in two flavors which have a slightly different code base: a Java 11 version and a Java 8 version.
We will use Java 11 concepts in the future and try to provide Java 8 compatibility where possible.

For that reason, the source code is duplicated:
-    src/main/java				contains the Java 11 compatible source files
-    src/main/java8				contains the Java 8 compatible source files

Although the two folder share some/many identical source files, we prefer this two folder layout
over one with a third folder like java-common.


### Building finmath lib

-    To build finmath lib for Java 11 use src/main/java
-    To build finmath lib for Java 8 use src/main/java8

These builds may be performed via Maven the profiles "java-11" and "java-8".
The eclipse project file is pre-configured to Java 11.

#### Maven build

The maven pom defaults to the Java 11 build. To build finmath lib for Java 8 use the maven profile "java-8".

Extensions
-------------------------------------

The [finmath-lib-cuda-extensions](http://finmath.net/finmath-lib-cuda-extensions/) implement the interface `RandomVariable` via Cuda GPU code. This allows to perform Monte-Carlo simulations on the GPUs with a minimal change: a replacement of the random variable factory.

The finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions implement the RandomVariableInterface via an AAD enabled version. This allows to access automatic differentiations with a minimal change: a replacement of the random variable factory.
Starting with version 3.3.1 the finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions is part of finmath-lib.


Coding Conventions
-------------------------------------

We follow losely the Eclipse coding conventions, which are a minimal modification of the original Java coding conventions. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Coding_Conventions

We deviate in some places:

-   We allow for long code lines. Some coding conventions limit the length of a line to something like 80 characters (like FORTRAN did in the 70'ies). Given widescreen monitors we believe that line wrapping makes code much harder to read than code with long(er) lines.

-	We usually do not make a space after statements like `íf`, `for`. We interpret `íf` and `for` as functions and for functions and methods we do not have a space between the name and the argument list either. That is, we write

    if(condition) {
      // code
    }
