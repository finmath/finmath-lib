===========

Mathematical Finance Library: Algorithms and methodologies related to mathematical finance.

Projects
--------

You will find several project in the repository.

**finmath lib**  
    Java library providing implementations of methodologies related to
    mathematical finance, but applicable to other fields (e.g., the
    Monte-Carlo simulation of SDEs and the estimation of conditional
    expectations in Monte-Carlo).

**finmath experiments**  
    Small experiments, illustrating some aspects of mathematical
    finance. Also illustrates how to use the finmath lib. Also contains
    a collection of spreadsheets building upon *finmath lib* and
    providing end user solutions (e.g, interest rate curve calibration
    or calibration of a forward rate model).

Documentation
-------------

-   [finmath lib API documentation][]  
     provides the documentation of the library api.
-   [finmath.net special topics][]  
     cover some selected topics with demo spreadsheets and uml diagrams.
    Some topics come with additional documentations (technical papers).
