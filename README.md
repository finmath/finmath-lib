===========

Mathematical Finance Library: Algorithms and methodologies related to mathematical finance.

*********************************************************

Projects
--------

You will find several project in the repository at finmath.net:

**finmath lib**  

Java library providing implementations of methodologies related to
mathematical finance, but applicable to other fields (e.g., the
Monte-Carlo simulation of SDEs and the estimation of conditional
expectations in Monte-Carlo).

**finmath lib is now on Java 8 (since February 2nd, 2014), but a Java 6 version is provided too.**

*Note: for convenience the provided Eclipse project is configured for Java 6. The maven pom defaults to Java 6. To build the Java 8 version use the profile "java-8", i.e. the maven command line option "-P java-8"*

**finmath spreadsheets**  
    A collection of spreadsheets building upon *finmath lib* and
    providing end user solutions (e.g, interest rate curve calibration
    or calibration of a forward rate model, aka LIBOR market model).

**finmath experiments**  
    Small experiments, illustrating some aspects of mathematical
    finance. Also illustrates how to use the finmath lib.

finmath lib Java Library: Distribution
--------------------------------------

Starting with version 1.2.19 finmath lib is distributed through the central maven repository. It's coordinates are:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>1.2.19</version>
	


finmath lib Java Library: Source code
-------------------------------------

The finmath lib Java library comes in two flavors which have a slightly different code base: a Java 8 version and a Java 6 version.
We will use Java 8 concepts in the future and try to provide Java 6 compatibility where possible.

For that reason, the source code is duplicated:
-    src/main/java				contains the Java 8 compatible source files
-    src/main/java6				contains the Java 6 compatible source files

Although the two folder share some/many identical source files, we prefer this two folder layout
over one with a third folder like java-common.


Building finmath lib
-    To build finmath lib for Java 8 use src/main/java
-    To build finmath lib for java 6 use src/main/java-6

These builds may be performed via Maven the profiles "java-8" and "java-6".
The eclipse project file is pre-configured to Java 6.

Documentation
-------------

-   [finmath lib API documentation][]  
    provides the documentation of the library api.
-   [finmath.net special topics][]  
    cover some selected topics with demo spreadsheets and uml diagrams.
    Some topics come with additional documentations (technical papers).
