About finmath lib
==========


****************************************

**Mathematical Finance Library: Algorithms and methodologies related to mathematical finance.**

****************************************

The finmath lib libraries provides implementations of methodologies related to mathematical finance, but applicable to other fields. Examples are

- General numerical algorithms like
- Generation of random numbers
- Optimization (a Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is provided)
- Monte-Carlo simulation of multi-dimensional, multi-factor stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
- LIBOR Market Model
- Black Scholes type multi-asset model (multi-factor, multi-dimensional geometric Brownian motion)
- Equity Hybrid LIBOR Market Model
- Estimation of conditional expectations in a Monte-Carlo framework
- Calibration of market data objects like curves (discount and forward curve) or volatility surfaces
- Various interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, harmonic spline, Akima).
- Various interpolation entities (value, log-value, rate, etc.).
- Parametric curves like Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel-Svensson.
- Simulation of interest rate term structure models (LIBOR market model with local and stochastic volatility)
- Calibration of the LIBOR market model
- Valuation of complex derivatives (e.g. Bermudan/multi-callables)

The libraries have a focus on Monte-Carlo methods, interest rate products and models and hybrid models.

**finmath lib is now on Java 8 (since February 2nd, 2014), but a Java 6 version is provided too.**

*Note: for convenience the provided Eclipse project is configured for Java 6. The maven pom defaults to Java 6. To build the Java 8 version use the profile "java-8", i.e. the maven command line option "-P java-8"*

Distribution
--------------------------------------

finmath lib is distributed through the central maven repository. It's coordinates are:

	<groupId>net.finmath</groupId>
	<artifactId>finmath-lib</artifactId>
	<version>1.3.6</version>
	
The version there is currently the Java 6 version. You may build you own Java 8 version via mvn -P java-8.

Source code
-------------------------------------

The finmath lib Java library comes in two flavors which have a slightly different code base: a Java 8 version and a Java 6 version.
We will use Java 8 concepts in the future and try to provide Java 6 compatibility where possible.

For that reason, the source code is duplicated:
-    src/main/java				contains the Java 8 compatible source files
-    src/main/java6				contains the Java 6 compatible source files

Although the two folder share some/many identical source files, we prefer this two folder layout
over one with a third folder like java-common.


### Building finmath lib

-    To build finmath lib for Java 8 use src/main/java
-    To build finmath lib for java 6 use src/main/java-6

These builds may be performed via Maven the profiles "java-8" and "java-6".
The eclipse project file is pre-configured to Java 6.

#### Maven build

The maven pom defaults to the Java 6 build. To build finmath lib for Java 8 use the maven profile "java-8".



Repositories
-------------------------------------

Source code and demos are provided via Github and a subversion repository.

Although not recommeded, the repository contains an Eclipse procject and classpath file including all dependencies. We provide this for convenience. We provide <a href="/java/subversion">instructions</a> on how to checkout the code using the Eclipse IDE.
Of course, you may use the IDE of your choice by simply importing the maven pom.
