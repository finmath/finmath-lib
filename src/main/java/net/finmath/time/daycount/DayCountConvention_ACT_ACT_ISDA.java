/**
 * Implementation of ACT/ACT ISDA.
 * 
 * Calculates the day count by calculating the actual number of days between startDate and endDate.
 * 
 * A fractional day is rounded to the approximately nearest day.
 * 
 * The day count fraction is calculated using ACT_ACT_ISDA convention, that is, the
 * day count fraction is <i>n<sub>1</sub>/365</i> + <i>n<sub>2</sub>/366</i>, where
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>	<i>n<sub>1</sub></i> is the number of days falling into a non-leap year,</li>
 * 	<li>	<i>n<sub>2</sub></i> is the number of days falling into a leap year,</li>
 * </ul>
 * where the start date is included in the counting and the end date is excluded in the counting.
 * This means that from 31.12.2014 to 01.01.2015 the day count fraction is 1/366 since 2014 is a leap year.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class passed that standard benchmark test in the IDSA document see net.finmath.tests.time.daycount.DayCountConventionTest
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The class can be constructed using isCountLastDayNotFirst = true, which will change its behavior compared to above.
 * In this case the start date is excluded in the counting and the end date is included in the counting.
 * This means that from 31.12.2014 to 01.01.2015 the day count fraction is 1/365 since 2015 is not a leap year.
