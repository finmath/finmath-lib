/**
 * Implementation of ACT/ACT ICMA.
 * 
 * Calculates the day count by calculating the actual number of days between startDate and endDate.
 * 
 * A fractional day is rounded to the approximately nearest day.
 * 
 * The day count fraction is calculated using ACT_ACT_ICMA convention, that is, the
 * day count fraction is <i>n/(f*m)</i>, where
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>	<i>n</i> is the number of days between period start and the given day,</li>
 * 	<li>	<i>m</i> is the number of days between period start and period end,</li>
 * 	<li>	<i>f</i> is the number of periods within a year</li>
 * </ul>
 * where the start date is included in the counting and the end date is excluded in the counting.
 * 
 * In contrast to other daycount conventions this daycount conventions requires information on an
 * associated schedule of periods. It depends on the definition of period start and period end
 * and on the frequency.
 * 
 * This is implemented by providing an object implementing an <code>net.finmath.time.Period</code>
 * upon construction.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class can be constructed using isCountLastDayNotFirst = true, which will change its behavior compared to above.
 * In this case the start date is excluded in the counting and the end date is included in the counting.
 * This means that from 31.12.2014 to 01.01.2015 the day count fraction is 1/365 since 2015 is not a leap year.
 * </p>
 * 
 * Note: The daycount method {@link DayCountConvention_ACT_ACT_ISDA} is a special case of this method
 * for frequency being one, having annual periods from January 1st to December 31st.
