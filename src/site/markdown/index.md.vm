About finmath lib
==========


****************************************

**Mathematical Finance Library: Algorithms and methodologies related to mathematical finance.**

****************************************

The finmath lib libraries provides implementations of methodologies related to mathematical finance, but applicable to other fields. Examples are

- General numerical algorithms like
    - Generation of random numbers
    - Optimization (a Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is provided)
- Monte-Carlo simulation of multi-dimensional, multi-factor stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
    - LIBOR Market Model
    - Black Scholes type multi-asset model (multi-factor, multi-dimensional geometric Brownian motion)
    - Equity Hybrid LIBOR Market Model
    - Hull-White Short Rate Model (with time dependent parameters)
    - Merton Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
    - Heston Model (as Monte-Carlo Simulation)
- Estimation of conditional expectations in a Monte-Carlo framework
- Stochastic Automatic Differentiation (AAD) (requires finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions https://github.com/finmath/finmath-lib-automaticdifferentiation-extensions )
- Monte-Carlo Simulation on GPGPUs (via Cuda) (requires finmath-lib-cuda-extensions https://github.com/finmath/finmath-lib-cuda-extensions )
- Calibration of market data objects like curves (discount and forward curve) or volatility surfaces
    - Various interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, harmonic spline, Akima).
    - Various interpolation entities (value, log-value, rate, etc.).
    - Parametric curves like Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel-Svensson.
- Simulation of interest rate term structure models (LIBOR market model with local and stochastic volatility)
- Calibration of the LIBOR market model
- Valuation of complex derivatives (e.g. Bermudan/multi-callables)
- Hedge Simulation

The libraries have a focus on Monte-Carlo methods, interest rate products and models and hybrid models.

**finmath lib is now on Java 8 (since February 2nd, 2014), but a Java 6 version is provided too.**

*Note: for convenience the provided Eclipse project is configured for Java 6. The maven pom defaults to Java 6. To build the Java 8 version use the profile "java-8", i.e. the maven command line option "-P java-8"*
